# vogon

Corral `poetry` (and `pyenv`) into docker for deliciously containerized python development.

To get up and running:
1. `git clone` this repo to your local machine.
1. add the cloned vogon directory path to the beginning of your `PATH` variable.
1. `cd` into the cloned repo directory.
1. run `bash build.sh` (this will build the `vogon` docker image).
1. run `vogon poet` from whichever repo directory you want to use.
